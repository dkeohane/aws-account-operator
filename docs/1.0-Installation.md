## 1.1 - Prerequisites
Please ensure you have completed all necessary prerequisite steps before moving onto the Workflow Section below.

[All required prerequisites steps can be found in this section.](1.1-InstallationPrerequisites.md)

Please utilise the [Glossary](0.1-Glossary.md) for any terms or acronyms found in this documentation which you may find unclear. 

## 1.2 Workflow

First, an `AccountPool` must be created to specify the number of desired accounts to be ready. The operator then goes and creates the requested number of accounts.
When a [Hive](https://github.com/openshift/hive) cluster has a new cluster request, an `AccountClaim` is created with the name equal to the desired name of the cluster in a unique workspace.
The operator links the `AccountClaim` to an `Account` CR in the pool, and creates the required k8s secrets, placing them in the `AccountClaim`'s unique namespace.
The `AccountPool` is then filled up again by the operator. Hive then uses the secrets to create the AWS resources for the new cluster.

For more information on how this process is done, please refer to the [Custom Resources and Controllers](2.0-Custom-Resources-and-Controllers.md) page.

## 1.3 Testing your AWS account credentials with the CLI

The commands below can be used to test `Payer Account` credentials where we create new accounts inside the `Payer Account`s organization.
Once the account is created in the first step, we wait until the account is created with step 2 and retrieve its account ID.
Using the account ID we can then test our IAM user has `sts:AssumeRole` permissions to Assume the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` in the new account.
The `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` is created automatically when a new account is created under the organization.

```
aws organizations create-account --email "username+cli-test@redhat.com" --account-name "username-cli-test" --profile=orgtest

aws organizations list-accounts --profile=orgtest | jq '.[][] | select(.Name=="username-cli-test")'

aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ID>:role/OrganizationAccountAccessRole --role-session-name username-cli-test --profile=orgtest
```

## 1.4 Development

It is recommended to let the operator know when you're running it for testing purposes.
This has benefits such as skipping AWS support case creation.
This is done by setting the `FORCE_DEV_MODE` env var to `local` in the operator's environment.
This is already handled for you if you use one of the `make deploy-*` targets described below.

## 1.5 Operator Install

The operator can be installed into various cluster and pseudo-cluster environments. Depending which you choose, you can run in `local` mode or in `cluster` mode.
The local mode is known to work in a [Minishift](https://www.okd.io/minishift/) or [Code-Ready-Containers (CRC)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview) cluster, and a private [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) cluster.
The latter is known to work in a real [OpenShift Dedicated](https://www.openshift.com/products/dedicated/) cluster.

**Note:** You can try to mix and match; it might work.

Both local and cluster modes share predeployment steps. These can be done via `make predeploy`, which requires your AWS access key credentials.
You must be logged into the cluster as an administrator, or otherwise have permissions to create namespaces and deploy CRDs. For Minishift, this can be done:

```sh
oc login -u system:admin
OPERATOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID" OPERATOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" make predeploy
```

This does the following:
- Ensures existence of the namespace in which the operator will run.
- Installs the [credentials described above](#12-requirements).
- Installs the operator's [Custom Resource Definitions](deploy/crds).
- Creates an initially zero-size [AccountPool CR](hack/files/aws.managed.openshift.io_v1alpha1_zero_size_accountpool.yaml).

Predeployment only needs to be done once, unless you are modifying the above artifacts.

### 1.5.1 Local Mode

"Local" mode differs from production in the following ways:
- AWS support case management is skipped. Your Accounts will get an artificial case number.
- Metrics are served from your local system at http://localhost:8080/metrics

On a local cluster, after [predeploying](#15-operator-install), run

```sh
make deploy-local
```

will invoke the `operator-sdk` executable in `local` mode with the `FORCE_DEV_MODE=local` environment variable.

**Note:** The operator relies on `operator-sdk` v0.16.0. The syntax of the executable has changed over time, so this `make` target may not work with other versions.

### 1.5.2 Cluster Mode

In "cluster" development mode, as in local mode, AWS support case management is skipped.
However, metrics are served from within the cluster just as they are in a production deployment.

Once logged into the cluster, after [predeploying](#15-operator-install), running

```sh
make deploy-cluster
```

will do the following:
- Create the necessary service accounts, cluster roles, and cluster role bindings.
- Create the operator Deployment, including `FORCE_DEV_MODE=cluster` in the environment of the operator's container.

**Note:** `make deploy-cluster` will deploy the development image created by the `make build` target. As you iterate, you will need to `make build` and `make push` each time before you `make deploy-cluster`.

As with local mode, you **must** be logged into the cluster as an administrator, or otherwise have permissions to create namespaces and deploy CRDs.
